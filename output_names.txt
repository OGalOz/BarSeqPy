1. fit_quality.tsv:
    The quality dataframe prepared in analysis2
2. fit_genes.tab:
   The genes.GC dataframe with an extra column 'used' which contains
    True or False whether or not this gene was used in the analysis.
3. fit_logratios_unnormalized.tab:
   The 'lr' table with the extra columns of locusId, sysName and description,
    all the values are the logratios (unnormalized), which are floats,
    per experiment and over the locusIds (locusIds are rows).
4. fit_logratios_unnormalized_naive.tab:
   The 'lrNaive' table with the extra columns of locusId, sysName and description,
    all the values are the naive logratios (unnormalized), which are floats,
    per experiment and over the locusIds (locusIds are rows).
5. fit_logratios.tab:
   The 'lrn' table with the extra columns of locusId, sysName and description,
    all the values are the normalized logratios, which are floats,
    per experiment and over the locusIds (locusIds are rows).
6. fit_logratios_half1.tab:
   The 'lrn1' table with the extra columns of locusId, sysName and description,
    all the values are the normalized logratios inserted into the first
    half of the gene (which are floats,
    per experiment and over the locusIds (locusIds are rows)).
7. fit_logratios_half2.tab:
   The 'lrn2' table with the extra columns of locusId, sysName and description,
    all the values are the normalized logratios inserted into the first
    half of the gene (which are floats,
    per experiment and over the locusIds (locusIds are rows)).
8. fit_logratios_good.tab:
    We output the normalized log ratios on genes with a table that ONLY includes
    the genes we ended up using and the experiments we ended up using. (How 
    is this different from fit_logratios?)
9. gene_counts.tab:
    The 'tot' dataframe along with the genes, 'tot' is the total
    reads per gene.
10. fit_t.tab:
    The 't' dataframe along with the genes info (locusId, sysName, desc)
11. fit_standard_error_obs.tab:
    The 'se' dataframe along with the genes info (locusId, sysName, desc)
12. fit_standard_error_naive.tab:
    The 'sdNaive' dataframe along with the genes info (locusId, sysName, desc)
13. strain_fit.tab:
    This might be the largest file, it's the all.poolcount file along 
    with strain fitness for each strain and each experiment. It also
    includes the column 'previous_index' (why?)
14. expsUsed.tab:
    The experiments dataframe after lightly eliminating unusable experiments. 
15. cofit.tab:
    
16. specific_phenotypes.tab:
17. strong.tab:
18. high_fitness.tab:
19. html_info.json:
